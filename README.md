# ToDos_Basic
The project is a simple to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, modify and delete tasks in the list. It also supports classification of completed and unfinished work.

## Demo : https://todos-begin-webapp.netlify.app

## Here is a description of how the application works:

1. Main Interface: The interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Users can see the list of tasks and options to filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed).

2. Add New Task: Users can enter a new task in the input field and press Enter or click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

3. Display Task List: The added tasks will be displayed as list items. Pending tasks will have a checkbox, and completed tasks will be crossed out.

4. Edit Task: Users can click on the edit icon (pencil icon) to edit the content of an added task.

5. Mark Task as Completed: By clicking on the checkbox, users can mark a task as completed or pending.

6. Delete Task: Users can click on the delete icon (trash can icon) to remove a task from the list.

7. Task Categorization: Users can choose to filter tasks by status (all, pending, completed).

8. Task Count Statistics: The application displays the count of pending tasks, completed tasks, and the total number of tasks.

9. Data Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's Local Storage to retain information when users close and reopen the web page.

This project is simple and useful for managing daily tasks and helps users stay organized and efficient in their work.
